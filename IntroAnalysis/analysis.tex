\section{Boolean Algebra}

Boolean algebra is the algebra dealing exclusively with the values \emph{true} and \emph{false}.

The primary operations of Boolean algebra are \emph{negation} (also called \emph{not}) denoted by $\neg$, \emph{conjunction} (also called \emph{and}) denoted by $\land$, and \emph{disjunction} (also called \emph{or}) denoted by $\lor$.

Since Boolean algebra has only two elements, it is possible to enumerate all variable combinations for a function. This is often done in the form of a truth table --- a table listing the values of variables and the corresponding function value as rows. For example, Table \ref{primary-operations} gives a combined truth table for negation, conjunction, and disjunction. It also serves as the definition of these operations.

\begin{center}
    \captionof{table}{Truth table of primary operations}
    \label{primary-operations}
    \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|X|X|X|X|X|}
        \hline
        \thead{$X$} & \thead{$Y$} & \thead{$\neg X$} & \thead{$X \land Y$} & \thead{$X \lor Y$} \\
        \hline
        True  & True & False & True & True \\
        \hline
        True  & False & False & False & True \\
        \hline
        False  & True & True & False & True \\
        \hline
        False  & False & True & False & False \\
        \hline
    \end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\begin{defn}\label{implies}
    A statement $P$ \emph{implies} (also $\implies$) statement $Q$ if $Q$ is true any time that $P$ is true. When $P$ is false, $Q$ can be true or false. If $P$ is always false, then it implies all statements. $P \implies Q$ is equivalent to $Q \impliedby P$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}\label{iff}
    Statement $P$ \emph{if and only if} (also \emph{iff} and $\iff$) statement $Q$ if $P \implies Q$ and $Q \implies P$.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}{Boolean properties}\label{boolean-algebraic-properties}\proofbreak
    Conjunction and disjunction are commutative:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $x \land y = y \land x$
        \item $x \lor y = y \lor x$
    \end{enumerate}
    
    Conjunction and disjunction are associative:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $(x \land y) \land z = x \land (y \land z)$
        \item $(x \lor y) \lor z = x \lor (y \lor z)$
    \end{enumerate}

    Conjunction and disjunction are distributive:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $x \land (y \lor z) = (x \land y) \lor (x \land z)$
        \item $x \lor (y \land z) = (x \lor y) \land (x \lor z)$
    \end{enumerate}

    True is the identity element (see \ref{identity}) for conjunction and false is the identity element for disjunction:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $x \land true = x$
        \item $x \lor false = x$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Additional properties}\label{additional-boolean-properties}\proofbreak
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\neg(\neg x) = x$
        \item $x \land x = x$
        \item $x \lor x = x$
        \item $x \land \neg x = false$
        \item $x \lor \neg x = true$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
    
\begin{thm}{DeMorgan's Laws}\label{demorgan}\proofbreak
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\neg(x \land y) = (\neg x) \lor (\neg y)$
        \item $\neg(x \lor y) = (\neg x) \land (\neg y)$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{rmk}
    All properties in Theorem \ref{boolean-algebraic-properties}, Theorem \ref{additional-boolean-properties}, and Theorem \ref{demorgan} can be proved by simply writing out the corresponding truth tables.
\end{rmk}

\section{Sets}

\begin{defn}\label{set}
    A set is an unordered group of distinct elements.
\end{defn}

\begin{exmp}
    $\{1, 2, 3\}$ is a set containing three elements: $1$, $2$, and $3$.
\end{exmp}

\begin{note}
    $\{1, 2, 3, 3\}$ is also set containing three elements, since the elements of a set are distinct.
\end{note}

\begin{defn}\label{empty-set}
    The empty set (denoted $\emptyset$) is the unique set having no elements.
\end{defn}

One of the most fundamental operations of sets is the ``element of'' operation, denoted by $\in$. $x \in X$ is true precisely when $x$ is an element of the set $X$. Note that sets can be elements of other sets. $x \notin X$ is used to denote ``not an element of''.

\begin{exmp}
    $\left\{\{1, 2\}, \{\}\right\}$ is a set containing two elements: the set $\{1, 2\}$, and the empty set.
\end{exmp}

Set comprehensions, or set builder notation, is a method of precisely defining a set. It can take various forms, such as enumerating all (or implying such) the elements of a set (e.g. $\{1, 2\}$ or $\{1, 2, \ldots, 5\}$). Or it can be used to build a set from another, such as $\left\{2n \compbar n \in \N\right\}$, which says make a set by taking every natural number and doubling it --- these are, of course, the even natural numbers. Set comprehensions can be made more complicated by including a predicate, for example $\left\{n \in \N \compbar n \neq n^2 \right\}$ --- all natural numbers which are not their own square.

Two sets are equal when they contain precisely the same elements. For example, if we let $A = \{1, 1, 5, 2\}$ and $B = \{2, 2, 2, 1, 5\}$, then $A = B$ since for every element $x$ in $A$, $x$ is also in $B$ and vice versa.

\begin{defn}\label{subset}
    A set $T$ is a \emph{subset} of a set $S$ when every element of $T$ is also an element of $S$. This relationship is denoted $T \subseteq S$. $S$ is also referred to as a \emph{super set} of $T$.
\end{defn}

\begin{exmp}
    $\{1, 2, 3\}$ is a subset of $\{1, 2, 3\}$.
\end{exmp}

\begin{rmk}
    If a set $A$ is a subset of set $B$, and $B$ is a subset of $A$, then the sets must be equal. Showing that $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$ is a common way to prove that two sets are equal.
\end{rmk}

\begin{defn}\label{proper-subset}
    A set $T$ is a \emph{proper subset} of a set $S$ when every element of $T$ is also an element of $S$, but not vice versa --- that is, the sets are not equal. This relationship is denoted $T \subset S$.
\end{defn}

\begin{exmp}
    $\{1\}$ is a proper subset of $\{1, 2, 3\}$.
\end{exmp}

\begin{defn}\label{intersection}
    The intersection of sets $A$ and $B$ is the set $\left\{x \compbar x \in A \land x \in B \right\}$. It is denoted by $A \intersection B$.
\end{defn}

\begin{exmp}
    $\{1, 2, 3, 4\} \intersection \{3, 4, 5\} = \{3, 4\}$.
\end{exmp}

\begin{defn}
    The union of sets $A$ and $B$ is the set $\left\{x \compbar x \in A \lor x \in B\right\}$. It is denoted by $A \union B$.
\end{defn}

\begin{exmp}
    $\{1, 2, 3, 4\} \union \{3, 4, 5\} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$.
\end{exmp}

\begin{rmk}
    If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $(A \intersection B) \subseteq (A \union B)$. $A = B$ if and only if $(A \intersection B) = (A \union B)$.
\end{rmk}

\begin{defn}
    The complement of set $A$ with respect to some super set $U$ is the set $\left\{x \in U \compbar x \notin A\right\}$. The complement is sometimes denoted $A'$.
\end{defn}

\begin{exmp}
    Let $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$, and $A = \{1, 2\}$. Then $A' = \{3, 4, 5\}$.
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
    Let $U = \Z$, and $A$ the even numbers. Then $A'$ is the set of the odd numbers. 
\end{exmp}

\begin{rmk}
    $A' \union A = U$. $A' \intersection A = \emptyset$.
\end{rmk}

\begin{defn}\label{set-difference}
    The set difference of sets $A$ and  $B$, denoted $A \setminus B$, is the set containing all elements of $A$ which are not elements of $B$. $A \setminus B = \left\{x \in A \compbar x \notin B\right\}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}\label{symmetric-difference}
    The symmetric difference of sets $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \triangle B$, is defined to be the set $(A \setminus B) \union (B \setminus A)$.
\end{defn}

\begin{rmk}
    $(A \triangle B)' = (A \intersection B)$ when $U = A \union B$.
\end{rmk}

\section{Constructions}

The \emph{von Neumann} construction is one of several ways to construct the natural numbers. It defines $0 = \emptyset$, and defines a function (called the \emph{successor} function) $S(a) = a \union \{a\}$ for every set $a$. Along with the axiom of infinity from Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, this defines the set of natural numbers.

Using this construction, each natural number is the set of all preceding natural numbers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $0 = \{\}$
    \item $1 = 0 \union \{0\} = \{\{\}\}$
    \item $2 = 1 \union \{1\} = \{\{\}, \{\{\}\}\}$
    \item $3 = 2 \union \{2\} = \{\{\}, \{\{\}\}, \{\{\}, \{\{\}\}\}\}$
\end{itemize}

Notice that for natural numbers $n, m$, the number of elements of $n$ is $n$, and that $n \leq m \iff n \subseteq m$.

While sets are unordered groups of distinct elements, lists (also called $n$-tuples) are ordered groups of elements which are not necessarily distinct. An ordered pair $(a, b)$ is a list of a length two (a tuple), where $a$, and $b$ are elements of some set.

\begin{defn}\label{tuple}
    An ordered pair $(a, b)$ is a tuple of elements of some set.
\end{defn}

Ordered pairs (and $n$-tuples more generally) can be represented as sets themselves --- the pair $(a, b)$ can be represented as the set $\left\{a, \{a, b\}\right\}$.

\begin{defn}\label{cartesian-product}
    The Cartesian product of two sets $A$ and $B$ is denoted $A \times B$. It is equal to $\left\{\left(a, b\right) \compbar a \in A, b \in B \right\}$.
\end{defn}

\section{Binary Operations}

\begin{defn}
    A \emph{binary operation} is a mathematical operation of arity two, where both domains and the codomain are the same set.
\end{defn}

\begin{exmp}
    Addition on $\R$ is a binary operation, as are multiplication and subtraction.
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
    Let $S$ be the set of all functions $f : \R \to \R$. For any $f, g \in S$, let $f \circ g$ be the function in $S$ defined by $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$. This is a binary operation on $S$, called function composition.
\end{exmp}

\begin{defn}
    A binary operation $\circ$ on a set $S$ is commutative if $x \circ y = y \circ x$ for all $x, y \in S$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    A binary operation $\circ$ on a set $S$ is associative if $x \circ (y \circ z) = (x \circ y) \circ z$ for all $x, y, z \in S$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}\label{identity}
    Let $\circ$ be a binary operation on a set $S$. Then an element $e$ of $S$ is called a left identity if $e \circ a = a$ for all $a$ in $S$, and a right identity if $a \circ e = a$ for all $a$ in $S$. If $e$ is both a left and a right identity, then it is simply an identity.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
    Let $\circ$ be a binary operation on a set $S$. If $\circ$ has both a left identity and a right identity, then those identities are the same.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Let $e_1$ be a left identity for $\circ$ and $e_2$ be a right identity. Then $e_1 = e_1 \circ e_2 = e_2$, so $e_1 = e_2$.    
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
    If a binary operation has both a left identity and a right identity, it has only a single unique identity.
\end{cor}

\begin{defn}
    Let $\circ$ be a binary operation on a set $S$, and $e$ be an identity element. An element $x$ of a set $S$ is \emph{invertible} if there exists some $x' \in S$ such that $x \circ x' = e$. $x'$ is the \emph{inverse} of $x$.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
    Let $\circ$ be a binary associative operation on a set $S$, and $u \in S$ be an invertible element. Then for all $x, y \in S$, $(x \circ u = y \circ u) \implies (x = y)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Let $u'$ be the inverse of the invertible element $u$. Then $(x \circ u) = (y \circ u) \implies (x \circ u) \circ u' = (y \circ u) \circ u'$. Since $\circ$ is associative, this implies that $x \circ (u \circ u') = y \circ (u \circ u')$. Since $u \circ u' = e$, we have $x \circ e = y \circ e$, and so $x = y$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
    Let $\circ$ be a binary associative operation on a set $S$, and $u \in S$ be an invertible element. Then for all $x, y \in S$, $(u \circ x = u \circ y) \implies (x = y)$.
\end{cor}

\section{Equivalence Relations}

\begin{defn}
    A \emph{partition} $P$ of a set $X$ is a set of subsets of $X$ such that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\emptyset \notin P$ --- that is, none of those subsets are empty.
        \item $X = \bigcup_{A\in P}A$ --- that is, every element of $X$ is in a subset.
        \item $(\forall A, B \in P) A \neq B \implies A \intersection B = \emptyset$ --- that is, no element of $X$ is in more than one subset.
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{exmp}
    Let $X = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$. Then $P = \left\{\{1, 2, 3\}, \{4, 5\}\right\}$ is a partition of $X$ as every element of $X$ is an element of an element of $P$, no element of $X$ is an element of more than one element of $P$, and no element of $P$ is empty.
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
    The empty set has a unique partition --- the empty set.
\end{exmp}

\begin{defn}
    For a non-empty $X$, $P = \{X\}$ is the \emph{trivial} partition of $X$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    A binary relation $\sim$ on a set $X$ is, for all $x, y, z \in X$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Reflexive} if $x \sim x$.
        \item \emph{Symmetric} if $x \sim y \iff y \sim x$.
        \item \emph{Transitive} if $x \sim y$ and $y \sim z$ implies $x \sim z$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    An \emph{equivalence relation} is a \emph{reflexive}, \emph{symmetric}, and \emph{transitive} binary relation.
\end{defn}

\section{Modular Arithmetic}

\begin{defn}
    For $n \in \N, n \geq 1$, the set $\Z_n = \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$ is the integers modulo $n$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    Let $x \in \Z$. Then $x \bmod n = r$, where $x = qn + r$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    $\oplus_n$ is a binary operation on $\Z_n$ defined by $(a \oplus_n b) = (a + b)\bmod n$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    $\odot_n$ is a binary operation on $\Z_n$ defined by $(a \odot_n b) = (ab)\bmod n$.
\end{defn}

\end{document}
