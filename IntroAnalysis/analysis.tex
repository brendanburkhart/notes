\section{Sets and Lists}

\begin{defn}\label{set}
    A set is an unordered group of distinct elements.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}\label{empty-set}
    The empty set (denoted $\emptyset$) is the unique set having no elements.
\end{defn}

While sets are unordered groups of distinct elements, lists (also called $n$-tuples) are ordered groups of elements which are not necessarily distinct. An ordered pair $(a, b)$ is a list of a length two (a tuple), where $a$, and $b$ are elements of some set. 

\begin{defn}\label{tuple}
    An ordered pair $(a, b)$ is a tuple of elements of some set.
\end{defn}

Ordered pairs (and $n$-tuples more generally) can be represented as sets themselves - the pair $(a, b)$ can be represented as the set $\left\{a, \{a, b\}\right\}$.

\begin{defn}\label{cartesian-product}
    The Cartesian product of two sets $A$ and $B$ is denoted $A \times B$. It is equal to $\left\{\left(a, b\right) \compbar a \in A, b \in B \right\}$.
\end{defn}
