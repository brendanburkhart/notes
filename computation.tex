\section{Finite Automata}

\begin{defn}
    An \emph{alphabet} is a non-empty set whose elements are referred to as \emph{symbols}. \emph{Strings} (or \emph{words}) over a given alphabet are finite sequences of symbols from the alphabet. A \emph{language} is a set of strings over an alphabet.
\end{defn}

\begin{rmk}
    Alphabets and languages may be non-finite, but strings are generally considered to only include finite sequences. The empty string will be denoted by $\emptystring$.
\end{rmk}

\begin{defn}
    Let $\Sigma$ be an alphabet. Then the language consisting of all strings over $\Sigma$ of length $n$ is denoted by $\Sigma^{n}$. The \emph{Kleene closure} of $\Sigma$ is
    \begin{align*}
        \Sigma^{*} = \bigunion_{i\in\N}\Sigma^{i}.
    \end{align*}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    A (determinstic) \emph{finite automata} is a $5$-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$, where
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $Q$ is a finite set of \emph{states},
        \item $\Sigma$ is an alphabet,
        \item $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \to Q$ is the \emph{transition function},
        \item $q_0 \in Q$ is the \emph{start state},
        \item $F \subseteq Q$ are the \emph{accept states}.
    \end{itemize}
    An automata starts in state $q_0$, and is given an input consisting over a string over $\Sigma$. For each symbol $s$ in the input, the automata moves from state $q$ to state $\delta(q, s)$. Once the end of the input is reached, if the state $q$ of the automata is an accept state --- that is, $q \in F$, then the automata is said to have \emph{accepted} the input.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    The \emph{language accepted by} a finite automata $M$ is a language $A$ consisting of all strings over $\Sigma$ that are accepted by the finite automata. We denote this by $L(M) = A$. A \emph{regular language} is any language accepted by some finite automata.
\end{defn}

\begin{rmk}
    Finite automata can be represented as a graph, where states are represented as nodes, and transitions are edges between states, labelled by the symbol that triggers the transition. When graphically representing a finite automata as a graph, accept states may be represented as double-circled nodes.
\end{rmk}

    This language accepted by this finite automata is the set of all binary strings which end with \texttt{001}. We can use an inductive proof on the length of the longest input to prove this.

\begin{thm}\label{regular-language-union-intersection}
    Let $A$ and $B$ be regular languages, then $A \union B$ and $A \intersection B$ are also regular languages.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\Sigma$ be the union of the alphabets of $A$ and $B$. Since $A$ and $B$ are regular, we know that there exists finite automata $M_A = \left(Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, s_1, F_1\right)$ and $M_B = \left(Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_2, s_2, F_2\right)$. Now we construct a new finite automata that runs $M_A$ and $M_B$ in parallel. To do this, consider the finite automata $M = \left(Q, \Sigma, \delta, s, F\right)$, where $Q = Q_1 \times Q_2$, $s = (s_1, s_2)$, and  $\delta: (Q_1 \times Q_2) \times \Sigma \to Q_1 \times Q_2$ is defined by $\delta\left((p_1, p_2), a\right) = \left(\delta_1\left(p_1, a\right), \delta_2\left(p_2, a\right)\right)$.
    
    If $F = F_1 \times F_2$, then $M$ accepts precisely the strings accepted by both $M_A$ and $M_B$ --- that is, $L(M) = A \intersection B$. If instead $F = \left(F_1 \times Q_2\right) \union \left(Q_1 \times F_2\right)$, then $M$ accepts the strings accepted by at least one of $M_A$ and $M_B$ --- that is, $L(M) = A \union B$.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
    A \emph{non-determinstic} finite automata is a $5$-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$, where
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $Q$ is a finite set of \emph{states},
        \item $\Sigma$ is an alphabet,
        \item $\delta: Q \times \left(\Sigma \union \{\varepsilon\}\right) \to 2^{Q}$ is the \emph{transition function},
        \item $q_0 \in Q$ is the \emph{start state},
        \item $F \subseteq Q$ are the \emph{accept states}.
    \end{itemize}
    A non-determinstic finite automata $M$ accepts an input $w$ over $\Sigma$ when there exists $w'$ that causes $M$ to end in an accept state, where $w'$ is constructed by inserting any finite number of $\varepsilon$ into $w$.
\end{defn}

\begin{rmk}
    Standard determinstic finite automata may be referred to as DFAs, while non-determinstic finite automata may be referred to as NFAs.
\end{rmk}

\begin{rmk}
    A NFA can essentially be viewed as a DFA which can split into multiple parallel copies of itself.
\end{rmk}

\begin{thm}\label{dfa-nfa-equivalence}
    Let $N$ be a non-determinstic finite automata, and $L$ be the language it accepts. Then $L$ is a regular language. Equivalently, there is an equivalent determinstic finite automata for every non-determinstic finite automata.
\end{thm}
